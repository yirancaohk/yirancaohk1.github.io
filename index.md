<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Physics Ph.D. candidate at [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Ravelosona dafiné](https://www.spin-ion.com/about-us/), the director of research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) and CTO of [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/). My research involves magnetoelectric ("ME") materials for energy-efficient information technology and "ME" materials for data security in information technology using Multiferroics/Magneto-ionics/Surface charging, with a special focus on the boosting magneto-ionic effect using ion irradiation and implantation.
## Research Interest:
- **Ion-material Simulation:** SRIM, iradina, IMSIL, CORETO, TRIDYN, MARLOWE, RustBCA
- **Machine Learning:** fairness AI, penalization and augmentation methods
- **E-field controlled magnetization** VCMA, Strain-mediated ME (Magnetoelectric) Effects, Straintronic, iontronic, E-filed induced spin reorientation, SOT.
- **Micro-, Nanofabrication**
- **Neuromorphic Computing** Neuromorphic Sensing and Perception, Hybrid Computing Systems, Brain-Inspired Robotics
